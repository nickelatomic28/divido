# Frontend Code Test

Hey :wave:, thanks for taking the time to do our technical test!

## Task

Your goal is to build a product called Application Form. This product will dynamically generate a form based on data received from an API using React.

There are three banks requesting an Application Form:

- Bank of Azeroth
- Naboo Bank
- Middle Earth Bank
-

## UX and Design

Itâ€™s entirely up to you how you would like to design the Application Form! Feel free to use 3rd party tools like `emotion` or `material-ui` (already installed as a dependency).

## Testing

```bash
yarn test:cypress
```

will run our Cypress tests.

Feel free to add some more end-to-end cypress tests, or present what tests you would add if you had more time.
